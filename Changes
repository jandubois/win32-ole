Revision history for Perl extension Win32::OLE.

Changes in version 0.01-0.03 are by Gurusamy Sarathy. All other changes
are by Jan Dubois unless attributed otherwise.

0.1007	Sun, April 25th, 1999
	- patches from ActiveState for sample code in OLE.pm POD section
	- Win32::OLE::Const now correctly treats version numbers as hex
	- use SvPV_nolen() where appropriate
	- Win32::OLE::NLS methods: SetLocaleInfo, SendSettingChange
	- Win32::OLE::Variant::Put returns $self for chaining
	- Win32::OLE::Variant::Put(ARRAYREF) implemented
	- Win32::OLE->WithEvents() function
	- new Win32::OLE::Variant methods: Currency/Date/Number/Time
	- AssignVariantFromSV() fixes for locale related VT_DATE/VT_CY problems
	- Win32::OLE::Variant::Get/Put fixed for VARIANT|BYREF pointing to ARRAY
	- several robustness enhancements to compensate for Perl's indeterminate
	  sequence of global object destruction
	- Win32::OLE->EnumAllObjects() function
	- t/6_event.t tests for WithEvents functionality
	- DCOM support in Win32::OLE->new() finally documented
	- GetObject and GetActiveObject now support optional DESTROY argument
	- OVERLOAD now works in DESTRUCTOR callback too
	- new file NEWS.pod describes user visible changes

0.1006	(unreleased)
	- replace many XSRETURN_UNDEFs by XSRETURN_EMPTY
	- various TypeInfo/TypeLib changes; Win32::OLE::GetTypeInfo() added
	- trial implementation of Win32::OLE::QueryInterface

0.1005	PRK update, ActivePerl 509
	- rearrange PL_* definitions for 5.004_05 compatibility
	- dependency on Win32::Registry removed. Win32::OLE::Const now uses XS
	  code to search the registry. Now only needs read access to registry.
	  Also reads the registry only once and caches typelibrary information.
	- Win32::OLE->GetActiveObject() and Win32::OLE->GetObject() methods now
	  also support an optional destructor as a 2nd argument.
	- Export SetSVFromVariantEx from DLL too. Change SetSVFromVariant() to
	  call SetSVFromVariantEx(..., bByRefObj=FALSE) instead of TRUE.
	- removed Typeinfo.pm from Makefile.PL/MANIFEST before sending to AS.

0.1004	(unreleased)
	- SetVariantFromSV calls VariantClear instead of VariantInit
	- new Win32::OLE::Variant $object->Copy() method
	- new Win32::OLE->Option() class method for CP/LCID/Warn access
	- removed COINIT_ALREADYINITIALIZED and __DisableOleInit
	- Win32::OLE::Variant->LastError added for backward compatibility
	  (it's now just a proxy for Win32::OLE->LastError)

0.1003	(included with ActivePerl 507)
	- Win32::OLE::Variant: Support for SAFEARRAYs (VT_ARRAY) added
	  New methods: Dim/Get/Put
	- SetSVFromVariantEx() can optionaly convert VT_BYREF variants to
	  Win32::OLE::Variant objects instead of simply dereferencing them
	- Win32::OLE::Variant "shares" class variables with Win32::OLE now
	- Initialize/Uninitialize/SpinMessageLoop reset LastError
	- EXPERIMENTAL ITypeInfo stuff
	- CP_MACCP, CP_UTF7, CP_UTF8 constants in OLE.pm
	- Win32::OLE::Enum::All converted to XS code. Enum.pm is now just POD
	- New Win32::OLE::Lite module which requires *no* additional modules
	- New COINIT_ALREADYINITIALIZED mode (and Win32::OLE::__DisableOleInit
	  constant) to disable COM initialization by Win32::OLE
	- {Ole|Co}Uninitialize() no longer called when the corresponding
	  Initialize didn't succeed

0.1002  (released by ActiveState with ActivePerl builds 505 and 506)
	- contains Win32::OLE::__DisableOleInit stuff ???

0.1001	(unreleased)
	- No longer needs XSLock(); all C functions now receive a pPerl pointer
	- Some functions exported for use by embedders (PerlSE, PerlCOM)
	- PPD entries added into Makefile.PL

0.10	Thu Sep 10 17:32:16 1998 (libwin32-0.14)
	- memory corruption fix (for ->SetProperty method) by Gurusamy Sarathy
	- document *nitialize(), SpinMessageLoop()

0.0902	(unreleased)
	- Allow specification of apartment model to Initialize() method. Special
	  case is COINIT_OLEINITIALIZE to fall back to OleInitialize(). This
	  is required to instantiate objects using compound document technology,
	  like e.g. "MAPI.Session".
	- Compatibility module now uses OleInitilize()

0.0901	(unreleased)
	- PL_na replaced by local variables
	- Dispatch method now accepts [wFlags, 'method'] to specify
	  various dispatch flags, e.g. DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUT
	- new $Obj->SetProperty() methods supports setting properties
	  with parameters
	- bug fix: the DCOM spec ['host', 'prog.id'] is no longer 'shifted'
	- more doc tweaks

0.09	(unreleased)
	- fix conversion from VT_DISPATCH/VT_UNKNOWN Win32::OLE::Variant objects
	  into Win32::OLE objects (were previously blessed into wrong class)
	- dynamically load CoInitializeEx to make OLE.dll compatible with 
	  "Win95 without DCOM" once again
	- convert Perl globals to PL_xxx form (with defines for Perl 5.004_xx)
	- minor doc tweaks
	- call CoFreeUnusedLibraries() whenever an OLE object is released

0.0810  (unreleased, maybe PRK for Win32 version, included by ActivePerl 501)
	- Removed USE_SV_PERINTERP, perl_atexit() only used for 5.004_68 and up

0.0809  (unreleased) identical to 0.0808

0.0808  (unreleased)
	- Introduced USE_SV_PERINTERP to switch off perl_atexit() usage

0.0807  (unreleased)
	- OleInitialize replaced by CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_MULTITHREADED)
	  (as suggested by James Snyder). This gets rid of the hidden top-level
	  window problem.
	- Fixed warning in Win32::OLE::Const when called without arg

0.0806  (unreleased)
	- Bug fixes for IsLocalMachine()
	- Free per-interpreter memory area at interpreter-exit
	- Bootstrap no longer static function
	- Use MY_VERSION as key/variable name for per-interpreter data

0.0805  (unreleased)
	- Never do CLSID lookup by registry on local machine
	- try to use socket APIs too to determine host identity
	- make all globals per-interpreter variables / remove DllMain
	- proper per-interpreter cleanup for all Perl versions

0.0804  (unreleased)
	- Fix breakage in GetOleObject (from 0.0801) for 5.004_04 and earlier
	- Ignore DCOM hostname if it seems to be the local machine

0.0803  (unreleased)
	- Rearrange t/3_ole.t to behave nicely when Excel is not installed
	- Win32::OLE->Dispatch: only warn about unidentifiable method name
	  when C<use strict "subs"> is in effect (kind of)
	- Most error msgs and warnings are prefixed with Win32::OLE version#

0.0802  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE->new(['Machine', 'Prog.Id']) does a remote registry lookup
	  if the Prog.Id is not registered locally.
	- CLSCTX changed to CLSCTX_REMOTE_SERVER when a machine is specified.
	  Otherwise OLE would still prefer a local server when available

0.0801  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE::Tie::(FETCH|STORE) now interpret $^H correctly
	- removed all Perl related stuff from DllMain (for embedded stuff)
	- Additional checks in GetOleObject for Perl 5.004_05 or later

	- Win32::OLE::Variants are actually freed during DESTROY now
	- Misc. robustness fixes (VariantClear etc.)

0.0609  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE::LastError() returns $Win32::OLE::LastError

	- New C<in> function; C<With> renamed to C<with>
	- Const module now defines xlConstant instead of $xlConstant
