Revision history for Perl extension Win32::OLE.

0.0613
	- WinOleEnum objects where never Safefree()d before
	- New Initialize/Uninitialize class methods. Uninitialize zombifies all
	  OLE objects an calls OleUninitialize.

0.0612
	- new Win32::OLE->SpinMessageLoop() class method
	- Messageloop will be emptied before OleUnitialize is called
	  (thanks to Steve Glassman for finding this problem!)

0.0611
	- Win32::OLE::Tie::Store use DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUTREF for objects
	  (as suggested by Steve Biondi)
	- all OLE calls now automatically reset LastError
	- added devel/dumprot.cpp tool to distribution

0.0610
	- Win32::OLE::Const now loads consts from all TKINDs and not only ENUMs
	- Win32::OLE::Variants are actually freed during DESTROY now
	- Misc. robustness fixes (VariantClear etc.)

0.0609
	- Win32::OLE::LastError() returns $Win32::OLE::LastError
	- misc COSERVERINFO fixes

0.0608
	- use scode from excepinfo structure when available instead 
	  of DISP_E_EXCEPTION (as suggested by Steve Glassman)
	- misc. Get(WideChar|MultiByte) robustness enhancements
	- Win32::OLE::new now uses CLSTLX_SERVER
	-         "       allows specification of remote server name
	-         "          "         "       of numeric class id

0.0607
	- enhanced C<in> allows multiple args and supports array refs too
	- SetSVFromVariant array bug fixes
	
0.0606
	- use SvTRUE instead of SvIV to convert SV to VARIANT
	- REFCNT of returned SV for VT_ARRAY variant is now set correctly
	- SAFEARRAYs of VT_DISPATCH and VT_BSTR (and VT_VARIANT containing
	  those) are now handled correctly
	- folding of SAFEARRAYs removed again. Original structure is maintained
	  t/3_ole.t adjusted accordingly
	- Win32::OLE::Enum->All doesn't call Reset anymore

0.0605
	- Property enumeration now dereferences TKIND_COCLASS etc.
	- Overloading in Win32::OLE now only enabled by OVERLOAD pseudotarget
	- Win32::OLE::CreateObject function for compatibility w/"Learning Perl"
	- Win32::OLE->LastError returns a dual value now (IV and PV)
	- Removed unsupported TKIND_ and VT_ constants from Win32::OLE::Variant
	- lcidDefault changed back to LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT, the language
	  neutral setting didn't allow portable scripts either
	- Sample file type converter script in eg/word2xxx.pl
	- valof uses CP and LCID of arg class for variant conversion

0.0604
	- New package variable Win32::OLE::Tie specifies 'Win32::OLE::Tie' class
	- Win32::OLE::Tie FIRSTENUM/NEXTENUM added for compatibility mode
	- Win32::OLE::Tie STORE/FETCH renamed. Added default method argument
	- Default method retries enabled under C<no strict 'subs';> only
	- New C<in> function; C<With> renamed to C<with>
	- Const module now defines xlConstant instead of $xlConstant
	- multi-dimensional arrays are folded to lower dimensions if possible
	  (e.g. 1x1 array -> scalar, 1x5 array -> list of 5, 5x1 -> unchanged)
	- new regression tests: unicode, variant
	- new sample: eg/word2pod.pl
	- first cut of NLS.pm module
	- compiles and tests ok with 5.004_60 built with -DUSE_THREADS
	- new C<valof> function
	- Win32::OLE objects overloaded conversion to strings and numbers

0.0603
	- Win32::OLE::Enum::Count method removed
	- SetSVFromVariant now works with SAFEARRAYs of non-VARIANT types too
	- Onedimensional SAFEARRAY of UI1s converted to SvPV
	- OLE, Enum and Variant objects all linked in g_pObj chain
	- g_pObj chain protected by critical section to make it thread safe
	- New package variables $CP,$LCID for Win32::OLE and Win32::OLE::Variant
	- default lcid changed from LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT -> language neutral
	- LastOleError is stored in a package variable $LastError now
	- Error reporting now controled by $Warn package variable
	- Win32::OLE::Variant: new As,ChangeType,Type,Unicode,Value methods
	- Win32::OLE::Variant overloaded "" and 0+ operations
	- Preliminary Variant BYREF support
	- Dispatch can return Win32::OLE::Variant objects too
	- Compatibility package "OLE" created
	- Invoke method added, supports default method too
	- Memory leaks
	- "keys %$object", QueryObjectType and Win32::OLE::Const::Load no
	  longer croak when the GetTypeInfo is unavailable or returns 0
	- Enum::new returns undef if object is not a valid collection object
